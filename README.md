**Holla**  
I am a Typescript developer and I have been a developer for more than 5 years, professionally 2 years. I write scalable codes using any of the following stack:  
1. Typescript
2. Javascript
3. Next JS
4. React JS
5. Express
6. GraphQL
  
I also write along the way. I've found that I understand web development concepts better when I try to explain it to imaginary students. You can check out my blog [here](https://blog.alvastack.com.ng)
